8320,2020-10-22 13:45:00+00:00,1319273554282647555,@RossouwBeyers Think we will see a move after election day as that will have a major influence on oil price. And then after 20 November. Don't feel the share will get up to the R300 as it was in Jan again for awhile. But has potential to get back to R150 maybe by December. Hopefully.,NickLaz93

Sure, it's a NO-BRAINER as the oil price has fallen from $93 in 2014 to $40 today.  Lower oil price = lower costs.

However, the CAPEX invested is an entirely different situation.  Falling EROI = HIGHER CAPEX.
